# EmployeeList

EmployeeList is a simple AngularFire application that allows the user to add and delete employees from a database. Employees are defined by their name, email address, and hire date, and can be sorted in ascending or descending order by any of those categories by clicking on the corresponding buttons. To access the website, follow this link: https://employeelist-7ec3d.firebaseapp.com

This application is built on a modified version of Jake Richter's AngularJS CRUD App, which can be accessed here: https://github.com/jprichter/ang-crud
